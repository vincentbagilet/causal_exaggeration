Details of version 1 on openicpsr for "Data and Code for: Methods Matter: P-Hacking and Publication Bias in Causal Analysis in Economics"

Note: In Stata you can type the command datasignature to get a unique dataset identifier.
The version 1 Methods Matter data files, and their data signatures are:

Fstat.dta		datasignature 3256:10(95591):2755832633:3425838957
MM Data with WP.dta	datasignature 31027:107(119074):1438339394:1335359924
MM Data.dta		datasignature 21740:148(68890):3956062851:2692497238
Star Wars Data.dta	datasignature 17883:12(76413):4077728055:3114314280


Changes Made

1. There have been no changes to Fstat.dta.

2. We applied "change1.do"
This do file changes the calculated z-statistics from reported p-values from one-sided to two-sided tests. 
We thank Sebastian Kranz and Peter Putz for pointing this out. 
In "MM Data.dta" this makes 1003 changes in total. 
In "MM Data with WP.dta" this makes 1003 changes in total.

The resulting data signatures are:

MM Data with WP.dta	datasignature 31027:107(119074):2119239319:1058122093
MM Data.dta		datasignature 21740:148(68890):325086678:2415259150

2. The next change made to "MM Data.dta" was the authors manually checked test statistics where z = 2, in order to help Putz and Kranz with their comment. The process took in this file 

MM Data.dta		datasignature 21740:148(68890):325086678:2415259150

And produced this file

MM Data.dta 		datasignature 21740:160(61238):2901585861:4006186001

Which is the most current version of the "MM Data" files.

3. The next change for the project is an updated Star Wars Data to include all of the variables from the original 2016 study, while retaining the same subset of observations used in MM's publication. This new file is:

Star Wars Data.dta	datasignature 17883:143(63128):3722800302:911165737

To confirm it is the same observations as originally used in methods matter apply this line:
keep year journal issue article_page first_author t method IV DID RCT RDD MULTI
And the data signatures will now match.

4. The next change for the project corrects a typo in make_AK_model_csv.do. The original version of this code dropped t>100, when the published figure used t>10 (row 14 of do-file). The newly uploaded version of make_AK_model_csv.do is corrected.
