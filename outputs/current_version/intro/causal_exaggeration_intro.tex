		%To avoid confounding, causal identification strategies focus on a subset of the variation in the data; the plausibly exogenous part. In this paper, I argue that this can reduce statistical power and lead estimates to exaggerate true effects sizes. Using realistic Monte Carlo simulations and a mathematical derivation, I show that for the main causal strategies, a perfectly convincing identification does not guaranty an absence of ``bias'' and that improving identification can actually pull us away from the true effect. I then discuss potential avenues to address this issue.
		
		%Quasi-experimental studies make empirical economics credible. To avoid confounding, causal identification strategies focus on a subset of the variation in the data, the plausibly exogenous part. In this paper, I argue that it can reduce statistical power and lead published estimates to exaggerate true effects sizes. Using realistic fake data simulations and a mathematical derivation, I show that %for the main causal strategies, there can be a trade-off between confounding and exaggeration: we may avoid a bias at the risk of generating another one.
		%using the main causal identification strategies to avoid a bias can also generate another one. I then discuss potential avenues to address this issue.\\~\\
